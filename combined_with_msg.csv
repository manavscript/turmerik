It will be monitored under real conditions of use to detect rare side effects or late complications. It can therefore be withdrawn from the market at any time. Among the many molecules tested, those concerning oncology occupy a prominent place. In this field, Canada is also participating in almost one in five trials initiated around the world.     **Cancer: the hope of clinical trials**     In Villejuif, in the Paris region, the Gustave Roussy Institute is a major center with numerous clinical trials that advance cancer research.   Patients included in a research protocol must first sign a consent form. This document provides, among other things, informed information on the product tested, the precise course of the test and the risks of side effects.   For the PEMBIB clinical trial, the patient first takes a blood test and an electrocardiogram.

46,28cclhhq,290.0,"Types and phases of clinical trials There are different types of clinical trials including the ones that follow.  The **clinical trials** to assess new treatments or new ways to make them more effective existing treatments. You can study new drugs or new methods to perform surgery or administer radiotherapy, for example. This is the type of clinical trial in which people with cancer participate most frequently.  The **prevention trials** to assess new ways to reduce the risk of cancer or prevent it from reappearing.  The **screening trials** help to find ways to detect cancer early in humans, before they experience symptoms.  The **diagnostic tests** used to find better ways to diagnose cancer or to determine the stage.  The **trials supportive care** possible to find ways to improve comfort and quality of life for people with cancer or cancer survivors.  ## Phases of a clinical trial  The clinical trial that involves a new treatment always takes place in several stages called phases. Each phase is designed to answer specific questions. The following are the most common phases of a cancer clinical trial, as per [Canada Contract Research Organization](https://www.biopharmaservices.com/).  In **phase 1** , a new treatment is often evaluated for the first time in humans. This helps to know how safe it is and what is the best dose to administer. The Phase 1 trial is usually offered to people with advanced cancer who no longer respond to treatment or who have no other treatment options. In general, 15 to 30 people participate in the phase 1 trial.  In **Phase 2** , the degree of effectiveness of a treatment against a certain type of cancer is demonstrated. The extent to which the treatment is safe and the possible side effects continue to be assessed. In general, fewer than 100 people participate in the Phase 2 trial.  In **Phase 3** , a promising new treatment is compared to standard therapy, which is the recognized treatment that is generally given for a condition or illness. Researchers especially want to know if the new treatment is better than the standard treatment. People from around the world can participate in a Phase 3 trial. In general, the number of participants ranges from several hundred to several thousand.  In **Phase 4** , more information is collected on the possible effects of treatment, whether good or bad, after its use has been approved in Canada. In general, several hundred to several thousand people participate in the phase 4 trial.  ## Randomized clinical trials  The clinical trial can be designed to include different groups. Most of the time, there are 2 groups, but you can count more. One group is the control group, that is, the participants do not receive the study treatment. The other group is the experimental group, that is, the participants receive the treatment under study.  To make sure groups can be compared, it's a computer that randomly assigns each person to a group. You are as lucky to be part of the experimental group as the control group. This is called randomization.  There are 2 types of randomization.  For **blind randomization** , researchers know who is in the experimental group and who is in the control group, but study participants are unaware of this. This prevents them from doing things that could affect the results of the study.  For **double-blind randomization, trial** participants do not know which group they belong to, just like the researchers. In the field of science, the design of this study seems to be the best since neither researchers nor participants can affect the results of the study by doing things they think they should do depending on the group.  ## Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials  Placebo is a pill or injection that looks like the tested substance but has no action at all. Administering a placebo to one of the clinical trial groups allows the researchers to compare the new placebo treatment. No placebo is administered instead of effective standard therapy. In a trial, for example, a new treatment associated with standard treatment with a placebo associated with the standard treatment can be compared. This tells researchers if the new treatment is effective.  Placebo is given in double-blind trials. You will be told if a trial is using a placebo, but you will not know if you are in the placebo group or the researchers elsewhere.
